"""Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or 
uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_)."""

# For example:
# snake_case
# MACRO_CASE
# camelCase
# CapWords

"""Create a name that makes sense. For example, vowel makes more sense than v.
If you want to create a variable name having two words, use underscore to separate them."""

# For example:
# my_name
# current_salary

"""Use capital letters possible to declare a constant."""

# For example:
# PI
# G
# MASS
# SPEED_OF_LIGHT
# TEMP

"""Never use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc."""

"""Don't start a variable name with a digit."""
