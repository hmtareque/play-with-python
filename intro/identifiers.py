#Python Identifiers
"""
An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. 
It helps to differentiate one entity from another.
"""

#Rules for writing identifiers
""" 
- Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _. Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
- An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is a valid name.
- Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
- We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.
- An identifier can be of any length.
"""

#Things to Remember
"""
- Python is a case-sensitive language. This means, Variable and variable are not the same.
- Always give the identifiers a name that makes sense. While c = 10 is a valid name, writing count = 10 would make more sense, and it would be easier
  to figure out what it represents when you look at your code after a long gap.
- Multiple words can be separated using an underscore, like this_is_a_long_variable.
