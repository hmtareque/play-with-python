"""A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. 
It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information 
which cannot be changed later."""

"""We can think of constants as a bag to store some books which cannot be 
replaced once placed inside the bag."""

"""Assigning value to constant in Python
In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned in a module. 
Here, the module is a new file containing variables, functions, etc 
which is imported to the main file. Inside the module, constants are written in 
all capital letters and underscores separating the words."""


# Create a file constants.py:
