"""Most of the programming languages like C, C++, and Java use braces { } to define a block of code.
Python, however, uses indentation."""

"""A code block (body of a function, loop, etc.) starts with indentation and 
ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be 
consistent throughout that block."""

"""Generally, four whitespaces are used for indentation and are preferred over tabs."""

# Here is an example.

for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i)
    if i == 5:
        print("Hasan is great!")

a = 10
if a != 5:
    print("Elizaaa ...")

"""The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean. 
This results in Python programs that look similar and consistent."""
