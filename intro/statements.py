"""Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements. 
For example, a = 1 is an assignment statement. if statement, for statement, while statement, etc. 
are other kinds of statements which will be discussed later."""

# Multi-line statement
"""In Python, the end of a statement is marked by a newline character. 
But we can make a statement extend over multiple lines with the line continuation character (\). 
For example:"""

a = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8 + 9

print(a)

"""This is an explicit line continuation. 
In Python, line continuation is implied inside parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], and braces { }. 
For instance, we can implement the above multi-line statement as:"""

a = (1 + 2 + 3 +
    4 + 5 + 6 +
    7 + 8 + 9)

print(a)

"""Here, the surrounding parentheses ( ) do the line continuation implicitly. 
Same is the case with [ ] and { }. For example:"""

          'blue',
          'green']

#We can also put multiple statements in a single line using semicolons, as follows:

a = 1; b = 2; c = 3

print(a, b, c)
