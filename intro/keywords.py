    - Keywords are the reserved words in Python.
    - We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier. 
    - They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.
    - In Python, keywords are case sensitive.
    - There are 33 keywords in Python 3.7. This number can vary slightly over the course of time.
    - All the keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as they are.
